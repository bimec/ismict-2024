								<p>"Wireless Body Area Network (BAN) has been researched and developed for digital medicine and its standard like IEEE802.15.6 and ESTI Smart BAN are now on amendment and revision.
								</br>In particular, the revision IEEE802.15.6ma has been focusing on enhanced dependability of wireless BAN and extended to automotive use cases for autonomous driving and remote maintenance of vehicle body as well as highly dependable Brain-Machine-Interface (BMI) for human wearable and implant medical healthcare devices.  
								</br>For the revision with enhanced dependability various physical and MAC layers of technologies have been proposed and applied for the new standard. For instance, cognitive channel coding corresponding to required QoS levels of packets and coexistence environment with same BANs and other radios.  Hybrid MAC of contention access and free protocols corresponding to QoS levels and coexistence environments etc.  
								</br>A new market of such a dependable BAN for human and vehicle bodies has been expanding and covering a new service for driving assistance such as human errors in driving with vehicle BAN and AI for elderly drivers etc. It makes a new paradigm of automotive and medical healthcare industries. Device benders of Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) may have more motivation to develop a new device of ranging and communication. 
								</br>ETSI Smart BAN has been focusing on smarter implementation for human BAN for medical healthcare devices with standard of data container format etc. It may have common specification with ETSI Smart M2M.
								</br>The special session can introduce latest progress of the BAN standards and required technologies and possible innovation in Beyond 5G or 6G with BAN to accomplish some of SDGs by active representatives of academia, industry, and government."

					Digital twin technology has emerged as a powerful tool for creating virtual representations of real-world systems, allowing for the simulation, analysis, and optimization of these systems in a controlled environment. Life sciences is primed for digital twin technology, which can integrate diverse data sources and reconstruct comprehensive, dynamic models of biological systems. These medical digital twins can facilitate drug discovery, optimize treatment plans, and even replace traditional clinical trials with simulations on virtual patients. In this presentation, I will discuss our efforts toward the development of a general-purpose Immune Digital Twin. I will discuss its uses to better understand the dynamics of the immune system across different scales of biological organization. To exemplify our methods in the context of drug development, I will also share our very recent results of new antiviral combinatorial treatments for influenza identified from an underlying model of host-pathogen interactions between influenza and airway epithelial cells.

					Gene delivery, or the transfer of protein-encoding nucleic acids into a cell, exhibits great potential for addressing questions and challenges in both research and medicine, with applications in functional genomics, tissue engineering, vaccines, and cell and gene therapies. Nonviral gene delivery systems offer a safer and more easily modified alternative to viral vectors, but often suffer from low delivery efficiencies and limited transgene expression (i.e., transfection). Investigation into nonviral gene delivery through computational modeling offers an alternative to focused empirical approaches, providing insight into complex cellular process behavior, as well as a means of testing hypotheses in a highly accessible context. We have developed a computational model of HeLa cell transfection based on telecommunications principles and queueing theory techniques, wherein the transfection process is represented as a packet-switched telecommunications network. The model was the first transfection model reported to incorporate the effects of both mitosis and transfection-induced toxicity, features critical for accurately recapitulating the full transfection process.  In addition, the model provided key insights into post-nuclear barriers that may prevent successful transfection. We have since translated the model to one representing transfection in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC), a clinically relevant cell type. Through model architecture modification and parameter optimization, we have demonstrated the roles of mitosis, toxicity, and post-nuclear events in defining hMSC transfection outcomes and donor-variability. Additionally, our hMSC transfection model suggests potential roles of two cellular processes not yet considered in transfection-related models: degradation of nuclear plasmid DNA following the onset of mitosis and spontaneous transcriptional suppression of transgene expression. This model provides a tool for probing the dynamic cellular processes involved in hMSC transfection, which can be used to improve nonviral gene delivery methods for therapeutic applications.

					This presentation will focus on fluorescent sensor array-enabled bacterial pathogen identification and classification. Timely and efficient identification of pathogenic microorganisms is of high importance for public health and safety. Most currently developed sensing methods are based on optical and/or electrochemical techniques, where selectivity is achieved by using antibodies, their fragments, natural or engineered peptides, or aptamers. Important limitations for using these elements as a part of the sensor are cost, stability, special handling, and a narrow range of analytes. Here a sensor array for multivariate analysis based on small molecule ratiometric fluorescent dyes will be described, including bacterial species and gram status identification. The adaptation to a paper-based platform will be described, which was the first step in developing a platform that could go beyond a traditional laboratory environment. Finally, our experience at implementing pattern analysis approaches will be discussed in the context of sensitivity and specificity of standard clinical approaches.

					<b>Dr. Aaron Mohs, PhD.,</b> is an associate professor in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and is the Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Studies of the UNMC College of Pharmacy. Dr. Mohs is also a member of the Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center. He received his B.A. in Chemistry from St. John’s University/College of St. Benedict (Collegeville, MN) and received his Ph.D. in Pharmaceutics and Pharmaceutical Chemistry at the University of Utah under Dr. Zheng-Rong Lu. Dr. Mohs then completed his postdoctoral fellowship in the joint Emory-Georgia Tech Department of Biomedical Engineering, as an Emory-Georgia Tech Center for Cancer Nanotechnology Excellence Distinguished Fellow with Dr. Shuming Nie. Dr. Mohs has an active, NIH-funded, collaborative research program on the development of fluorescent probes to guide the surgical resection of tumors, fluorescent sensor array technology that can rapidly detect and identify bacterial pathogens, and drug delivery systems to target multiple myeloma. Dr. Mohs is the immediate past-President of the UNMC Faculty Senate and recently served as the Director of the Pharmaceutical Sciences Graduate Program. Dr. Mohs is a recipient of the 2017 UNMC New Investigator award, 2019 UNMC Distinguished Scientist award, and, most recently, selected as a Fellow of the National Strategic Research Institute at the University of Nebraska. Prior to joining UNMC in 2015, Dr. Mohs was an assistant professor of Biomedical Engineering in the Wake Forest – Virginia Tech School of Biomedical Engineering and Sciences.
