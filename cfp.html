				<!--p class="subtitle" id="presentation">Information to Presenters</p>
				<p><div align="justify">
					To appear in the conference proceedings, all accepted papers must be presented at the conference, even in the virtual conference. Please carefully follow these 
					instructions to ensure the successful presentation of your contribution.
					</div></p>

					<h3>DEADLINE FOR UPLOADING THE REQUIRED MATERIAL AS PER THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS: April 27th, 2023</h3>
					</div></p>		

					<p><div align="justify">
					Oral presentations can be delivered via <i><u>live presentation</u></i> or through a <i><u>pre-recorded presentation</u></i>. If you plan to give a live presentation, we 
					strongly recommend that you do a practice via Zoom (with others watching via Zoom), just so you're used to the platform and its tools.
					</div></p>
					
					<p><div align="justify">
					In the preparation of your video, consider the following guidelines:
					<ul>
						<li>You can use any tool to record your recording. However, as we will be using Zoom to run the virtual conference, we 
							strongly suggest to use Zoom to pre-record your presentation. Instructions as to how to record your presentation talk 
							with Zoom can be found below in this document.</li>
						<li>We suggest to use 16:9 format for your videos.</li>
						<li>Videos should be recorded in one of the following formats: mp4, avi.</li>
						<li>Make sure that your video adheres to the time constraints reported below.</li>
					</ul>
					</div></p>
					
					<p><div align="justify">
					If you opt for a live presentation, the video will be played only in case of technical difficulties, otherwise the pre-recorded video will be played live during the session 
					by one of the virtual conference assistants. If, instead, you opt for a pre-recorded presentation, the presenter must be connected in any case in order to take questions 
					from the attendees after the presentation.
					</div></p>
					
					<p><div align="justify">
					<b>Remember that, failing to be present live during your session without strongly justified reasons, will be considered as a no-show, and the paper will be excluded from the proceedings.</b>
					</div></p>

					<p><div align="justify">
					<b>TIME CONSTRAINTS for VIDEOS:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Technical paper: 15 min</li>
						<li>Invited paper/speech: 25 min</li>
						<li>Keynote speech: 45 min</li>
					</ul>
					</div></p>

					<p><div align="justify">
					After preparing your pre-recorded video and the other material you must perform the following steps:
					<ol>
						<li>Save the video file of your TALK according to the following convention: EDASPAPERNUMBER_NAMEOFPRESENTER (e.g. 123456_SMITH). The PAPERNUMBER can be found on EDAS under the field 'Session'.</li>
						<li>Register yourself as presenter on EDAS: Login -> select the paper in the 'My Papers' section -> list yourself as 'Presenter'.</li>
						<li>Upload your video directly on the EDAS page of your paper.</li>
					</ol>
					</div></p>

					
					<p><div align="justify">
					Instructions for recording your presentation with Zoom are available <a href="./docs/ZoomVideoRecordingInstructions.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
